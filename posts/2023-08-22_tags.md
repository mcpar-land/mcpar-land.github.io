Just another little update to the site. Added tags to posts! Check them out in the head of each post.

There's also some more polish all around.

- A 404 page
- A link back to the top of the page
- Image labels

![](/static/embeds/2023-08-22_tags/cat.webp 'Put a label on this cat.')

You do it with this syntax [which is apparently part of Markdown](https://dev.to/stephencweiss/markdown-image-titles-and-alt-text-5fi1).

```markdown
![](/static/embeds/2023-08-22_tags/cat.webp 'Put a label on this cat.')
```

Neat.
